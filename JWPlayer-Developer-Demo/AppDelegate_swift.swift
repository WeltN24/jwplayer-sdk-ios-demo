   This method is overridden to make it more similar to our app.
   Because our app is portrait mode only we had to hack this in order to enable fullscreen for videos.
   A side effect to this is, that when no video is in the viewport, when rotating the device, the status bar still rotates but the rest stays in portrait
   
   
   
   It is actually not needed to override this method to produce the other issue, so feel free to comment this method and enable all orientations in the target if needed
